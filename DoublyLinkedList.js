 * Doubly Linked List

 * 
 * -Each node contains data and TWO links to the
 * next and previous nodes in the list.
 * 
 * -The head node is the node at the beginning of the list,
 * the tail node is the node at the end of the list.
 * 
 * -The head node's previous pointer is set to NULL
 * 
 * -The tail node's nodes next pointer is set to NULL
 * 
 * Function DoublyLinkedList takes
 * .addToHead()
 * .addToTail()
 * .removeHead()
 * .removeTail()
 * .removeByData(data)
 * .printList()
